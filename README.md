# Pascal-Compiler
Compiler for the Pascal programming language
This project consisted of creating a compiler for the Pascal programming language. This compiler scanned, parsed, and created assembly language object code. 
The source statements were passed through a lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis that then translated error-free source code into Assembly code.
